    "- Does the sentence contain a modal verb (should, must,...) between the two entities?\n",

    "- Number of drugs between a pair of drugs\n",
    "- POS of words between a pair of drugs: This is a binary feature for word POS tags obtained from POS tagging, and indicates the presence or absence of each POS between the two main drugs.\n",
    "- Path between a pair of drugs: Path between two main drugs in the parse tree is another feature in our system. Because syntactic paths are in general a sparse feature, we reduced the sparsity by collapsing identical adjacent non-terminal labels. E.g., NP-S-VP-VP-NP is converted to NP-S-VP-NP. This technique decreased the number of paths by 24.8%."
