In this study, the effects of etofibrate upon chylomicron metabolism was tested by determination of the plasma kinetics of a chylomicron-like emulsion model in 12 patients with coronary artery disease, aged 59+/-11 years, (total cholesterol: 240+/-41 mg/dl; triglycerides: 188+/-42 mg/dl) submitted to a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with administration of 1 g per day etofibrate or placebo for 1-month.
