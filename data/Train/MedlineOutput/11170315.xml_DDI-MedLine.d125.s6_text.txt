Prior administration of 4-methylpyrazole (90 mg kg(-1) body weight) was shown to prevent the conversion of 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol (100 mg kg(-1) body weight) to (-)-erythro-fluorocitrate in vivo and to eliminate the fluoride and citrate elevations seen in 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol-intoxicated animals.
