We conclude that the prophylactic and antidotal properties of 4-methylpyrazole seen in animals treated with 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol derive from its capacity to inhibit the NAD+-dependent oxidation responsible for converting 1,3-difluoro-2-propanol to 1,3-difluoroacetone in the committed step of the toxic pathway.
