This interaction, which has not been investigated using higher doses of fluvoxamine, may be more pronounced if a 300 mg daily dose is co-administered, particularly since fluvoxamine exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetics over the dosage range 100-300 mg. If alprazolam is co-administered with Fluvoxamine Tablets, the initial alprazolam dosage should be at least halved and titration to the lowest effective dose is recommended.
