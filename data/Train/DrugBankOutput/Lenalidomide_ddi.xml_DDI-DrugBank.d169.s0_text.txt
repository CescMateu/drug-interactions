Results from human in vitro metabolism studies and nonclinical studies show that REVLIMID  (lenalidomide) is neither metabolized by nor inhibits or induces the cytochrome P450 pathway suggesting that lenalidomide is not likely to cause or be subject to P450-based metabolic drug interactions in man.
