There were no significant differences between the pharmacokinetics parameters of amiodarone administered intravenously or intragastrically and the control (without neferine) group (with ratios of 0.7-1.4 in all experimental groups), suggesting that neferine had no effect on amiodarone plasma pharmacokinetics.
