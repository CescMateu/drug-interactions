Pharmacologic experiments and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that the observed changes in the epileptic tissue were due to a decreased ratio of the main Cl(-) extrusion transporter (K(+) -Cl(-) cotransporter, KCC2) to the main Cl(-) uptake transporter (Na(+) -K(+) -2Cl(-) cotransporter, NKCC1).
